# Database description
uic_covid_contact_tracing is a database which will provide information on covid test results for faculty and students attending UIC. Entities will include people, events, and organizations.

Each student has a unique student ID (UIN), and has a list of classes and organizations they are in. They also will have a preferred contact method (phone, email, or text) to be contacted to inform them of any potential exposures to COVID-19. Additionally, their vaccination status should be entered into the database as well as the date and result of their most recent COVID-19 test. Similarly, faculty should also have this data entered into the database. Other tables will include the members of different organizations and classes as well as a directory of voluntarily provided student and faculty contact information. When students take their COVID-19 tests and results are available, the database can be updated with their most recent test and result.


This should be a web-based system, available for access via a web browser on web-browsing enabled devices in order to provide as much accessibility as possible. 

This database system will not be publicly accessible except to contact tracing teams to keep sensitive information private, so searching on public search engines will not yield any results for campus database access.
